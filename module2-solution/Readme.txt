This is solution to assignment # 2 For Coursera "Single Page Web Applications With AngularJS"

This app displays two lists. One list contains the items to buy and other contains items to buy. 
Initially the to buy list contains 6 items and bought item shows that there are no item bought.
When user clicks on bought button on any item on to buy list that item is removed from the 
buy list and added to bought list. Once all the items have been bought the buy list shows that there\
are no more items to buy anymore.
