This is solution to assignment # 1 For Coursera "Single Page Web Applications With AngularJS"


NOTE: I have completed all the Bonus Tasks. So in my case an empty item is not counted.
So in my case a list with items "item 1, item2,,item3" will count as 3 items instead of 4 as i am not counting
empty items.

I also added code for the following tasks:

If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the font color green. If the message is "Please enter data first", make the font color red.
If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the border color around the textbox green. If the message is "Please enter data first", make the border color around the textbox red.


For my own reference
BrowserSync Command: browser-sync start --server --directory --files "**/*"
